    <h3>First Phone Call - Jan 27, 2019 [1:15pm]</h3>
    <h4>Pre-planned questions with answers:</h4>
    <p><i>Note that we didn't get all of our questions answered in this phone call.</i></p>
    <pre>What source control did you want to use? GitHub?
A: 

Did you want two separate native apps or a web app that will work universally across all platforms? Tell them the reason we think a web app would be the best is because with a web app we can cover all bases at once, Android, iOS, Windows, mac, everything. If someone reports it on their phone than the clerk can log in and see what the report says and issue what’s necessary.
A: 

Do you have a graphical designer for how it should look or did you have a color palette in mind? Mention that they threw out a bunch technology stacks but we really wanted to narrow down exactly what we are doing.
A: 

Really figure out what their expectations are, that’s something we need to figure out. Because we don’t want them thinking they will have a 100% full functioning, beautifully designed, infinitely scaleable application.
A: 

Ask them how they are wanting to monetize exactly? I.e. could it be charging the cities a relatively small amount and not showing advertisements to users?
A: He doesn’t expect it to be a final product. We won’t necessarily have to figure out this part yet. They expect this to be a first draft to be scrapped and redone later if it presents well to a hedge fund.

Do you have any general idea of what milestones to aim for?
A: It’s up to us. Milestones aren’t really set up. Basically, meet the milestones and time frames presented in class. 

Does Brain have a time that we could contact him?
A: He can jump in the calls if he’s needed. He said he’d rather not get him involved if possible.

<b>One caveat:</b> Brain is the one to ask technical questions. It is up to us to decide how to implement it. As long as it matches the general idea, we can do it our way. Also, another team in Washington state already tried to do this same project and failed. They didn’t take it seriously or something so Brain isn’t going to try to help this time. So it is up to us.

<b>Notes/what he(Morgan) said:</b> The main gist behind is that most municipalities out here don’t have apps that focus on non-emergency situations. They want to come up with a generalized app that any city and municipality can use at a reasonable price. NY had to pay 250k for theirs. This app will cut out redundancy and generalize the process. There could be scope creep. We need it to be geared towards the citizen, nothing more, nothing less. Most people won’t use all of the features. Main idea is to create a working product for them to show off so they can get funding.

    <h3>Second Phone Call - Feb 3, 2019 [1:15pm]</h3>
    <p>Summary:</p>
    <pre>
We talked about what we’ve done recently in regards to the project. We’ve been working on deciding which technology stack to use and what the webapp would look like. We created a very rough wireframe for website and mobile view:
    
    <a href="https://gyazo.com/02ff0b564541020823c694b9e8174a05" target="_blank">Website View</a>
    <a href="https://gyazo.com/7753222270f14188c18809ff63ea240e" target="_blank">Mobile View</a>

Morgan’s response to our wireframe: Make sure you look at New York and LA’s systems and look for inspiration. Basically it is up to us to make it pretty.

Morgan said that the Washington team said they were concerned about the lack of clarity but replied that he thinks this is the right way to go about it and he wants us to figure this out ourselves and that he doesn’t have time to micromanage us. He plans to have us work with the Washington team and to share ideas with them. They are wondering how we get the information to the right people in the municipality. I suggested that when we are offering this to different municipalities that we ask them to determine who could deal with the normal issues and those people or departments could get admin accounts that would be notified when their issue arises.

Morgan was saying that he also wants the app to work and be able to make reports even if the municipality hasn’t accepted it yet. That way people can report issues anywhere and those issues can be kept track of and eventually they can pitch their app to that municipality with all of the unsolved issues that have been unaddressed that have been captured through the app. Then they could monetize admin accounts with that municipality. He said that we don’t need to implement the admin portal yet, though. 

As for levels of access, it seems that it is pretty much admin and non-admin. He said that we’d have to brainstorm and figure that out. Finally, he said that we need to come up with a timeline of what we are thinking, hopefully by next week.</pre>

    <h3>Third Phone Call - Feb 10, 2019 [1:15pm]</h3>
    <p>Summary:</p>
    <pre>Before this phone call we were able to develop an approximate timeline for completing this application:
<blockquote>Week 1: Work on learning language and starting basic front-end design
Week 2: Create login with different user types and posting board
Week 3: Create ability to post, upvote/downvote, edit posts, delete posts - all dependent on user status
Week 4: Midterms - polishing front-end
Week 5: Spring break - no milestones
Week 6: Start work on back-end and hosting on Github
Week 7: Polishing front-end and add quality of life features
Week 8: Polishing back-end, BAT testing, testing robustness, attempting location testings</blockquote>During our phonecall with Morgan, we were informed that his company had just discovered that there is actually another competitor app that does almost the same thing as ours is supposed to. He said he didn't know if we would be able to continue and asked us what we thought. We said we would be willing to continue. Morgan then said that his company took on a responsibility for us when we started but that he doesn't know where we will go from here and ended the call short. He said he would send us the email of the competitor app and we would talk next week about what to do. We were given no goals for next week besides to look at the article; we are basically treading water, unsure if they will continue to work with us or not. </pre>

    <h3>Fourth Phone Call - Feb 17, 2019 [1:27pm]</h3>
    <p>Summary:</p>
    <p>Before this phone call we were able to create all of the initial  Angular setup code and push it to the Github.</p>
    <pre>Phone call was delayed to 1:27 because Morgan forgot to join the conference call. Him and Brain joined the call and asked us where we are at on the project. We discussed our plan to begin working on the landing page and move on from there. Discussed the posibility of using Django or NodeJS as the backend for the app. However, we are still deliberating as to which language to use. Finally, we were offered help with hosting using compartmentalization or Ubuntu servers or whatever we need. Brain said that he is not concerned that there is competition and that he is confident in this product and that we are going to do a great job.</pre>

    <h3>Fifth Phone Call - Feb 24, 2019 [1:15pm]</h3>
    <p>Summary:</p>
    <pre>We went over what we achieved in the last week, which hasn't been much on account of other more pressing responsibilities. According to Morgan, Brain was impressed by us. Morgan wanted to know if we are on track on the project, which we replied that we feel that we are very much on schedule. I said that even though we haven't been able to do any coding this week, what we have been doing for the project has been useful for preparing to actaully begin working on the project. We've solidified our game-plan and should have a more detailed roadmap to work from once we <i>do</i> begin coding more heavily.
    
Morgan then asked if we had any questions for him, to which we replied that we think we have no questions and feel we are on track. Morgan then asked that for next meeting we could do a Zoom meeting in conjunction with the Washington team to discuss both of our progresses and to feed off of each other. Morgan said that he would send us a Zoom meeting which would detail when the meeting would occur, since we are in different timezones, it is uncertain when exactly the next meeting will occur.</pre>

    <h3>Sixth Phone Call (Zoom Meeting) - Mar 3, 2019 [2:00pm]</h3>
    <p>Summary:</p>
    <pre>We joined a conference call with the Washington State team, Brain, and Morgan. We discussed different issues each team is having and shared ideas. Morgan brought up a great point in that there could be problems that arise from deciding who would take care of niche issues such as potholes in the road, which is handled by different places differently. Additionally, we learned about the setup that the WSU team has for the app, which is less login based and more ease of use based. They are also planning on using an app, not a webapp. All in all, progress as usual.</pre>

    <h3>No Phone Call March 10 or March 17 (Spring Break)</h3>
    
    <hr>
    <h3>March 11 - March 23</h3>
    <p>Summary:</p>
    <p>During this time, we did not have any scheduled contact with our client due to Spring break. Additionally, we did not make much headway on the project during this time as well as it would be difficult to organize since all of the team members had different plans for the break. However, James was able to make some progress near the end of the break on the login. At this point, our plan is to begin our first sprint and start making more progress in terms of coding. Our next phone call will be on the 24th of March.</p>

    <h3>Seventh Phone Call - Mar 24, 2019 [1:15pm]</h3>
    <p>Summary: upcoming...</p>
