		<h2>Week of Jan 7 to Feb 2</h2>
		<h3>Week Summary</h3>
		<p>This week we established a meeting scheduled to meet on a weekly basis via a conference call. I was unfortunately 
    unable to be on the first conference call because I had prior responsibilities on this day. I did, however, get notes 
	and brought up to speed by my teammates.</p>
	<p><i>This is the set of questions we came up with as a team. I was unable to be at the meeting for each question, even if they were not answered.</i></p>
    <pre>What source control can we use?
	A: No Answer, Our Team decided that GitHub would be the best solution for us.

Did you want two separate native apps or a web app that will work universally across all platforms? Tell them the reason we think a web app would be the best is because with a web app we can cover all bases at once, Android, iOS, Windows, mac, everything. If someone reports it on their phone than the clerk can log in and see what the report says and issue what’s necessary.
A: No Answer, We have started toying around with the idea about using a web stack such as MEAN. Mongo DB, Express JS, Angular JS, and Node JS. Due to the scopre of the project, native applications did not make sense.

Do you have a graphical designer for how it should look or did you have a color palette in mind? Mention that they threw out a bunch technology stacks but we really wanted to narrow down exactly what we are doing.
A: No Answer, we decided that we would do the best that we could with the design and implemention of the application

Really figure out what their expectations are, that’s something we need to figure out. Because we don’t want them thinking they will have a 100% full functioning, beautifully designed, infinitely scaleable application.
A: Their expectations are the middle of the road. They had a team last year that let them down, and did not deliver. We are thinking in our mind that we are going to deliver an MVP application because we cannot promise something out of the scope of time.\

Ask them how they are wanting to monetize exactly? I.e. could it be charging the cities a relatively small amount and not showing advertisements to users?
A: He doesn’t expect it to be a final product. We won’t necessarily have to figure out this part yet. They expect this to be a first draft to be scrapped and redone later if it presents well to a hedge fund.

Do you have any general idea of what milestones to aim for?
A: It’s up to us. Milestones aren’t really set up. Basically, meet the milestones and time frames presented in class. 

Does Brain have a time that we could contact him?
A: He can jump in the calls if he’s needed. He said he’d rather not get him involved if possible.

<b>One Issue:</b> Brain is the one to ask technical questions. It is up to us to decide how to implement it. As long as it matches the general idea, we can do it our way. Also, another team in Washington state already tried to do this same project and failed. They didn’t take it seriously or something so Brain isn’t going to try to help this time. So it is up to us.

<b>Notes/what he(Morgan) said:</b> The main gist behind is that most municipalities out here don’t have apps that focus on non-emergency situations. They want to come up with a generalized app that any city and municipality can use at a reasonable price. NY had to pay 250k for theirs. This app will cut out redundancy and generalize the process. There could be scope creep. We need it to be geared towards the citizen, nothing more, nothing less. Most people won’t use all of the features. Main idea is to create a working product for them to show off so they can get funding.

		<p>General Notes for this week's meeting are below:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The application does not have to be complex.</li>
      			<li>We are not the only university working on this product</li>
      			<li>We are developing a MVP for the customer to show to investors to help the real product gain traction.</li>
      			<li>Making decisions are mostly left to us, however any technical questions we can ask via a task software called Asana.</li>
      			<li>The requirements that we have been given, allow for free reign. I believe that it is preferred to 
      deliver a more simplistic application rather than a complicated application.</li>     
		</ul>

		<h2>Week of Feb 3 - Feb 10</h2>
		<h3>Week Summary</h3>
		<p>This weeks meeting we had a conference call with Morgan. From this we confirmed that we have creative freedom over
			the design of our application. This week we need to create a schedule to start developing our application. We 
			need to choose a technology stack to work with also. We also need to create our requirements document with
			deliverables. We created a basic wireframe to show morgan this week. He made the remark that it looks like MS DOS.
			For us this means that we need to create an application that is no just barebones but some kind of stylized approach
		    so that they can see the future of the application.</p>
		<p>Notes for this week's meeting are below:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>They want us to create the application from the reqs. of the PDF.</li>
      		<li>They do have a document that outlines the development of it, however they want to see what we deliver.</li>
			<li>They want a very basic easy to use design, a one size fits all approach.</li>
			<li>They want to create admin areas such to create a 'Pay Wall'.</li>
			<li>They want us to schedule a meeting with them and the washington team to hash out ideas.</li>
			<li>Morgan said that his dream of the application for municipalities that haven't paid for it yet is to be behind a pay wall 
				but can still get weekly reports.
			</li>
			<li>Two different levels of access going on in this application. Admin versus Non-Admin.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Week of Feb 10 - Feb 26</h2>
		<h3>Week(s) Summary</h3>
		<p>These weeks have been a little hetic for us all. At first we thought that we were going to have to scrap the project. 
			After we finally decided that we would continue with the project. The first real conference call was the last two sundays.
		</p>
		<pre>Before this phone call we were able to develop an approximate timeline for completing this application:
			<blockquote>Week 1: Work on learning language and starting basic front-end design
			Week 2: Create login with different user types and posting board
			Week 3: Create ability to post, upvote/downvote, edit posts, delete posts - all dependent on user status
			Week 4: Midterms - polishing front-end
			Week 5: Spring break - no milestones
			Week 6: Start work on back-end and hosting on Github
			Week 7: Polishing front-end and add quality of life features
			Week 8: Polishing back-end, BAT testing, testing robustness, attempting location testings</blockquote>
			During our phonecall with morgan he informed us that his company has discovered another application that does this job. He stated 
			if we wanted to we could just stop development and pick another application or they could part ways. This really sucked for the team.
			It was kinda turning point in this project. All of our motivations for the application had disipated into thin air. It was kinda bitter 
			sweet... After converstations with the teacher we finally decided that we would continue with the application and they would continue to be 
			customer. But in the back of all of our minds it was like being told by a boss. "I want to you work on this project. Another company has already worked on
			this project. We are thinking about laying you all off." </pre>

		<p>Notes for this week's meeting are below:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>MEAN Stack.</li>
      			<li>"Brain" really likes our ideas.</li>
			<li>We are going to talk with Washington U next week.</li>
			<li>They want to see our project plan.</li>
			<li>They are okay with letting us take the lead from here.</li>
			<li>We are going to ask for the next spring break conference calls off.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Week of Feb 26 - Mar 3</h2>
		<h3>Week(s) Summary</h3>
		<p>Work has officially started on the Project
		</p>
		<p>Notes for this week's meeting are below:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>They really like where out project is.</li>
      		<li>Puppet has been setup fully.</li>
			<li>Washington U didnt really contribute many ideas.</li>
			<li>We discussed different ideas for the development.</li>
			<li>Washington U seems like they are going down the native application path.
				We are unsure if this is the right road given time constraints and the kind of application in general.
			</li>
			<li>We have offically started on the login and logout of the application. This include user registration.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Week of Mar 3 - Mar 23</h2>
		<h3>Week(s) Summary</h3>
		<p>We have stopped all conference calls for spring break time lines.
		</p>
		<p>Notes for What I tried to get done this week:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Setup puppet pipelines and the AWS serve</li>
      		<li>Finished Registration after following a few Angular tutorials.</li>
			<li>Finished Login after extrapolating what I learned earlier.</li>
			<li>Used a tutorial to help me setup the JWT web token authentication.</li>
			<li>Login, Registration, User Dashboard are complete now! A few more things to add before I want to push.</li>
			<li>The project is moving along at a good pace right now</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<h2>Some time over Spring break...</h2>
		<h3>Week(s) Summary</h3>
		<p>I lost my code base...</p>
		<p>Lessons learned and what happened...</p>
		<ul>
			<blockquote>All I wanted to do is relax for a little bit and play some games with a friend... It was late at night, I had just finished
				developing the registration and user dashboard. I wasn't ready to push to Github yet because I was trying to finish the User Dashboard.
				My friend decided that we would play CIV 5 instead of 6. I hadnt had it downloaded for a while so I tried to download it and it complained about space.
				It had occured to me that I had been downloading alot of stuff for classes that I didnt need anymore. So I went to my downloads folder and purged everything.
				No permision needed because I made myself a super user on windows right? Me and my friend play it for 6-7 hours and are really enjoying it...

				Incoming panic:
				The next morning I wake up after a good gaming session and open up Visual Studio Code when it says, CAN'T LOCATION PROJECT FOLDER. Then the worst thing that could
				have happened happened. I deleted my gihub folder last night. Anything to do with git was in my download folder. OH NO. ITS ALL GONE.
