	<h2>1/27:</h2>
	<p>The team and our client Morgan Smith established a weekly conference call to discuss the 311 app: Sundays at 1:15.</p> 
	<p>Meeting notes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Disclaimer: we are working on one version of the application, and a team in Washington is working on their own, may collaborate on ideas.</li>
		<li>The goal is a Minimally viable product, the client want to showcase the base features of the app to future investors to take over and be able to deploy.</li>
		<li>“Brain” is the technical lead of this venture</li>
		<li>We will be scheduling ourselves, as well as deciding on implementation for the upcoming project. That means if we have decisions to make about any minute details, as long as they follow the requirements we were provided, we can do as we please. </li>
		<li>He then went over what the “plan” was for how this project is going to be monetized, and therefore how we should approach our future implementations. We need to keep in mind facts such as larger cities most likely already have a dedicated 311 app, and the idea for this one is an application that can be used by many different locations and not just restricted to one area, both catering to people being in multiple cities as well as smaller communities without access to a dedicated 311 application. This ties back to how we don’t need to worry about assigning admin privileges to certain locations yet, as more research will need to be done on their end on how to sort this out.
Further talk on monetization was discussed, such as how these communities should be able to post without having “subscribed”, but we need the administrative privileges as an incentive to subscribe ultimately. </li>

	</ul>

	<h2>2/03:</h2>
	<p>This week, Kyle created a wireframe to show Morgan a base landing-page to try an elicit more requirements. Morgan reiterated that he’s mostly fine with however we want to lay out the application, as long as its mostly a “one-page deal” and sticks to the requirements. </p> 
	<p>Meeting notes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Monetization: a municipality will subscribe to be able to forward issues to the corresponding facility. Worry about these features last.</li>
		<li>Clarification on requirements: ensure everything in the PDF is implemented, and we work on our own accord thereafter. </li>
		<li>Create a timeline containing plans for each week. </li>
		<li>Possibly contact Washington team</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>2/10:</h2>
	 <p>As requested, we approximated a schedule on how we’re going to progress with the project.</p>
	<li>Week 1: Researching the languages and libraries we plan on using for implementation, and begin on front end or templates.</li>
	<li>Week 2: Start on the login system, create different types of users, and getting the post dashboard planned out and slightly started.<li>
	<li>Week 3: Add the features relating to the dashboard, such as posting an issue, upvoting and downvoting posts, editing and deleting posts.</li>	
	<li>Week 4: “Time off” for our midterm week, said we would try to work on touching up the front-end if time allows.</li>
	<li>Week 5: This will be our spring break, no clear goals here
	<li>Week 6: Plans for hosting the application through GitHub, begin working on admin functionality
	<li>Week 7: With all of the above finished, go back and touch up on issues and if there aren’t many, add any quality of life features we can think of.
	<li>Week 8: Testing our application (BAT testing), try features we may/may not be able to finish with our scope, such as advanced admin features, geolocation, etc.

	<p>“Minor” roadblock though, Morgan is unsure of continuing with the 311 app with the teams, states competition from open source projects of a similar nature. He sent an email containing alternatives if we wanted to work with him still, such as another “Neighborhood” App, as well as a few other generic things. He says he is going to contact Jeff to see what the best course of action is, but out of all the application ideas and the fact that we’re already a month in, staying par with this course seems the best outcome for all of us. </p>

	<h2>2/17:</h2>
	<p>Crisis adverted, and we got to talk to the mythical Brain. We got to get down into the gory details with Brain, which was a nice change in pace as everything was more of a top-layer discussion prior to this. We discussed our plans on what we wanted to implement the backend with (NodeJS or Django seemed to be the favored), and we were offered to be able to use AWS from Brain to help us deploy. </p>
	<p> Brain addressed the elephant in the room, I wasn’t sure if he was a part of it or if he was just trying to reassure us, but he told us he was optimistic about the future of this project and was fully onboard to help us with any issues we’ll run into.</p>
		<p> We also got an angular skeleton of project pushed to repo.</p>
