		<h2>Week of Jan 27 to Feb 2</h2>
		<h3>Week Summary</h3>
		<p>This week we spoke with the customer to determine their baseline requirements for the application.
		As stated in the original project description, the customer wishes to create a web application which
		will provide citizens of a municipality to report non-emergency issues, much like how a 311 line operates
		in cities across the country. We also established a weekly meeting schedule with the customer to ensure
		that they are kept in communication with us throughout the process.</p>
		<p>Notes for this week's meeting are below:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The application we are building does not need to have complex features integrated, but needs
				to have basic functionality that works well. The product we create will ultimately be used
				as a proof of concept or working demo so that the customer may pursue funding to continue
				building their idea into an more detailed and profitable product.</li>
			<li>We are not the only university working on this product for the customer; they have a group of
				students at a university in Washington working on their own version of the product as well.
				Of course, we are to work completely individually, but there may be a time in which the customer
				would like our team to consult with this team during a meeting.</li>
			<li>Making decisions about the direction of the project should be made mostly by our team, but if
				a technical question must be answered, we may send the customer a message. Details about the
				program are up to the team to determine, as long as it fits the requirements previously
				given by the customer.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Week of Feb 3 to Feb 9</h2>
                <h3>Week Summary</h3>
                <p>This week we spoke to the customer to mainly discuss the potential styling of the web app, both in terms
		of layout as well as in coloring, etc. We have been told that the looks of the web app and overall design is 
		something that we will have to determine ourselves, but that we can feel free to consult with them if we have 
		any big issues we need to bring up.</p>
		<p>I created two basic wireframes, one that portrays the potential layout from the perspective of a desktop 
		device, as well as a wireframe which portrays how the app might look or be organized from the view of a mobile 
		device. We showed these to the client and it seemed they were okay with that as a preliminary design, but again 
		they reiterated that we have the final say in terms of the design.</p>
		<p>The client also gave more insight into the business model they wish to follow with this app later on, and 
		gave us an idea as to how this should influence our design decisions. I have included these notes below.</p>
                <p>Notes for this week's meeting are below:</p>
                <ul>
                        <li>The client has said they approve of the design we are considering based on the wireframes we have 
				supplied, but want to ensure that we understand we have the freedom to choose the final design. 
				While this is the case, if there are any large or pressing concerns, we should feel free to contact 
				them at any time.</li>
                        <li>The client is looking to have the service provided to smaller municipalities, and would likely be 
				working with each municipality to determine the best pricing model, etc. This being the case, even 
				municipalities who have not purchased the service would receive notifications of issues in their 
				jurisdiction. This works by allowing any citizen, even those within municipalities which have not purchased 
				the software, to report issues to the service. Administrators or contacts in that municipality's government 
				would then be notified that they have outstanding issues being reported by their citizens, and that they 
				can view or interact with them by purchasing the service.</li>
                        <li>While this pricing model could be considered during the creation of the software, the client has specified 
				that we should not make it a primary concern to implement any advanced features such as this. Since this 
				program that we are creating will just be used as a simple demonstration product for investors, these 
				more complex features do not need to be prioritized. However, the product should be fully functional at 
				least at a basic level.</li>
                </ul>

		<h2>Week of Feb 10 to Feb 16</h2>
                <h3>Week Summary</h3>
                <p>The primary purpose of this week's meeting was to talk with the client and establish a rough timeline of the 
		development process, from beginning to end. Up to this point, we have only been planning, and it will likely continue 
		this way for a couple more weeks, with the exception of possible basic code skeletons being created for our program. The 
		schedule we have come up with has been posted below.</p>
                <p>Rather interestingly, we were told by the client that they are unsure of the future of the project. They performed 
		market research and noticed that there is at least one other company that is developing a competing solution commericially, 
		so they are unsure if they wish to continue. They have said they will decide over the next week after talking with Chartos. 
		As of right now we are considering this a sort of state of limbo.</p>
		<p>The rough schedule we have made is below:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Week 1: Mainly learning the needed libraries for the project, possibly creating basic templates.</li>
			<li>Week 2: Begin work on the login system, possibly start work on the main issue board(s).</li>
			<li>Week 3: Start integration of post ratings, allowing users to vote on important issues.</li>
			<li>Week 4: This will be midterms week, so less work will be done, but mostly polishing current implementations.</li>
			<li>Week 5: This week is <b>Spring Break</b>, so there will likely be no development this week.</li>
			<li>Week 6: Begin work on the admin back end, as well as running the code through GitHub.</li>
			<li>Week 7: Most of the actual development work should be done by this point, so this will be mostly polishing.</li>
			<li>Week 8: Finish work on the admin back end, lots of testing, and possible implementation of extra features.</li>
		</ul>
                <p>Notes for this week's meeting are below:</p>
                <ul>
                        <li>We established a (very) rough timeline forthe project. The client says this looks good with them, and that as 
				long as we feel we are making sufficient progress then they have no issues with how we decide to go about the process 
				or how we divide our time.</li>
                        <li>The client has essentially put this project on hold after doing market research and determining that there are 
				companies that are currently working on competing commericial products. Because of this, they do not know 
				if they wish to continue. Because of this uncertainty, we will wait over the next days to see if they reach 
				a decision and consult with Prof. Chartos to see which direction he thinks we need to go.</li>
                </ul>

		<h2>Week of Feb 17 to Feb 23</h2>
                <h3>Week Summary</h3>
                <p>This week, our conference call was delayed after nobody from the client company joined the call until 1:27 (the calls 
		are scheduled for every Sunday at 1:15). After the delay, both Morgan and 'Brain' joined the call. This is the first call 
		we have had with Brain, though he seems much more technical. We gave him the info regarding what libraries and other 
		requirements we have planned for the project, and he seems to like the ideas we have. We are finalizing our decision on whether 
		to use Node or Python, though we are leaning towards Node.</p>
                <p>Brain also told us that if we need it he should be able to provide an Amazon AWS server instance for us to use to deploy 
		the app. We are currently unsure if we will need this, but if we do we will be contacting them, as it could definitely come 
		in handy, and may even be required depending on the route we choose. They have told us to contact them if there is anything 
		else that we need to be successful in creating the application.</p>
                <p>Brain also addressed the uncertainty that was introduced last week, apologizing on behalf of his partner and ensuring us 
		that they are fully committed to this project.</p>
                <p>Notes for this week's meeting are below:</p>
                <ul>
                        <li>Conference call delayed until 1:27. Morgan and Brain both joined the call, this call was more focused on technical 
				details for Brain to hear about the project, where we are, and where we plan to take things.</li>
                        <li>Brain approves of the direction we plan to take the project, and has offered to reserve an Amazon AWS server 
				instance if we need it. If we do end up needing it, we will be sure to contact them. It is definitely a 
				possibility.</li>
                        <li>Brain also has apologized for the uncertainty and jeopardy that the project faced after the last conference call. He 
				says they are fully committed to the project and are here to help us as we need it. This is reassuring.</li>
                </ul>

		<h2>Week of Feb 24 to Mar 2</h2>
                <h3>Week Summary</h3>
                <p>This week was mainly a progress update for Morgan to know where we are and what progress we have made over the last week. 
		We told him that we have pretty much settled on Angular and Node for this project, more specifically the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, NodeJS) 
		stack. Choosing this stack will allow a more convenient solution that not only provides Angular and Node as we had already established, 
		but also provides MongoDB, which will prove useful as a database engine for actually storing items such as issues, user accounts, etc.</p>
                <p>Brain joined the call towards the end, and we told him that we had settled on Node. We also confirmed that we would likely 
		be needing the Amazon AWS server instance that he offered us previously, and this information was sent to us via Asana.</p>
                <p>Morgan noted that next week he would like us to join a Zoom meeting with the student team at Washington State University so 
		that we can communicate with them to determine where they are, how they are approaching the problem, etc. Despite this call, 
		we will of course be working completely separately. This call is simply to bounce ideas off of each other and get another 
		point of view. Zoom meeting details and invites will be sent out via Asana or email.</p>
                <p>Notes for this week's meeting are below:</p>
                <ul>
                        <li>We updated Morgan and Brain on the progress we have made, which included pushing basic template code and settling 
				on using NodeJS and the MEAN stack.</li>
                        <li>We confirmed to Brain that we would likely be needing the Amazon AWS server instance he has offered before. He said he 
				would be sending these details to us soon.</li>
                        <li>Morgan has said he would like us to join a Zoom meeting next week with the student team at Washington State University. 
				He said he would be sending these details out to us. This meeting will serve to check and see where the WSU students are, 
				and to get an overall second point of view on the problem.</li>
                </ul>

		<h2>Week of Mar 3 to Mar 9</h2>
                <h3>Week Summary</h3>
                <p>This week we met in a Zoom meeting with Morgan, "Brain", as well as the other team from Washington University. We compared the 
		progress we have made on our project with the WU team, and it appears that we are largely at the same point in our projects. Just as we have, 
		their team just finished and submitted a detailed project planning document, and will soon start the actual coding for their application. The 
		WU team has said they currently plan to take less of a web app approach, contrary to our team's methods. The client seems pleased with either 
		approach, so long as it is still functional.</p>
                <p>We also compared our methods for user authentication/validation, and it seems that the WU approach is to allow anyone, registered or not, 
		to post and interact with the site. Our current plan is to allow guests to browse issues on the site without logging in, but interacting with 
		the issues, doing things such as posting or voting, will require them to log in. This is mainly to prevent spam and people voting on an issue 
		multiple times (one vote per account).</p>
                <p>We have decided, along with the client, that we will not be meeting on conference calls March 10-17, as it is Spring Break. We will resume 
		calls with the client on March 24.</p>
                <p>Notes for this week's meeting are below:</p>
                <ul>
                        <li>We met with WU team to determine where they are in the project - they are in a comparable spot as us (just finishing planning).</li>
                        <li>Our approach is to require users to log in if they want to post issues, WU is less focused on user logins at this point.</li>
                        <li>Meetings will be suspended for Spring Break but will resume March 24.</li>
                </ul>

		<h2>Week of Mar 10 to Mar 16</h2>
                <h3>Spring Break - No Meetings</h3>
		<hr>
		<h2>Week of Mar 17 to Mar 23</h2>
                <h3>Week Summary</h3>
                <p>This week we had a shorter meeting with Morgan in which we gave him a quick progress update. We let him know that we have mostly finished the 
		user registration aspect of the program, and that we will soon begin work on the main functionality of the program: allowing users to post and view 
		issues. Once work begins on this aspect, we expect that the pace of development will pick up, as Angular allows for aspects of the program to be 
		developed in components, allowing development to take place modularly. This means that instead of each component relying on the one before it, 
		they will be their own sections of the web app that can be updated independently, for the most part.</p>
                <p>Notes for this week's meeting are below:</p>
                <ul>
                        <li>We are mostly done with the user registration/login system and will soon work on the posting aspect.</li>
                        <li>We expect the pace of development to pick up once we start development on posting features.</li>
                        <li>We will check back in on progress in a call next week.</li>
                </ul>

		<h2>Week of Mar 24 to Mar 30</h2>
                <h3>Week Summary</h3>
                <p>This week was another quick meeting in which Morgan wanted to check whether or not we felt that we were on track with our program's development. 
		We told him that we were satisfied with where we stand as of right now, since we are just about completely done with the login system and have make a skeleton 
		for how the posting system will work. The amount of work we have left to do isn't too large, the most difficult part will be allocating time to do it.</p>
                <p>Notes for this week's meeting are below:</p>
                <ul>
                        <li>We are nearing completion with the login system.</li>
                        <li>We have started skeleton code for other aspects of the application and will be filling in where needed soon.</li>
                        <li>We will be checking back in on Mar 31.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr>
		<h2>Week of Mar 31 to Apr 6</h2>
                <h3>Week Summary</h3>
                <p>Because I was out of town on Mar 31, I was unable to join the call, but I have communicated with the team to find out where we are. While completing the 
		login system in the beginning of this week, we ran into an issue where the token for authentication was not being received by the system after the user tries 
		to login. We resolved this issue, and it turned out a needed module was not called. Besides that, we also finished work on the backend for the posting aspect 
		of the application. While the frontend has yet to be completed, this shouldn't be too difficult, since most of the code is written, it is now just a matter 
		of styling it.</p>
                <p>Notes for this week are below:</p>
                <ul>
                        <li>We ran into an issue with login tokens, but have resolved it and this part is now complete.</li>
                        <li>The core of the posting system has been finished as well, we just need to create the front end and we will have this mostly done.</li>
                        <li>We will have a Zoom meeting with WSU again on Apr 7 to check where they are and ask them any questions we may have</li>
                </ul>
                <hr>
		<h2>Week of Apr 7 to Apr 13</h2>
                <h3>Week Summary</h3>
		<p>This week we took part in a Zoom meeting in which we met with the WSU team to see where they are at in their implementation. It appears that they are moving 
		a little closer to the webapp plan, unlike the last time we had met with them. They're using different technologies, such as Flask. While we were not able to demo 
		our app this week (we have the backend fully functional, but not the front end), we will be good to go next phone call. It definitely feels like we are on track and 
		making good progress.</p>
                <p>Notes for this week are below:</p>
                <ul>
                        <li>Talked to WSU in a Zoom meeting and looked at their current application.</li>
                        <li>They have moved to a more web-centered approach as we have been doing.</li>
                        <li>We will likely be showing off our app next call.</li>
                </ul>
		<hr>
		<h2>Week of Apr 14 to Apr 20</h2>
                <h3>Week Summary</h3>
                <p>We did not get the chance to demo our solution this week because our client (Morgan specifically) was sick and unable to talk long. Instead, I sent a few 
		pictures of the app running to them if they were curious, but today was mainly just a checkup on how things are going and making sure we are on track for the 
		final demo next week with WSU. We should be more than ready by then.</p>
                <p>Notes for this week are below:</p>
                <ul>
                        <li>Morgan was sick so we couldn't demo our current app.</li>
                        <li>We are on track with the project and do not feel we have fallen behind.</li>
                        <li>We will be ready to demo our project along with WSU next week.</li>
                </ul>

		<h2>Week of Apr 21 to Apr 27 - Final Log</h2>
                <h3>Week Summary</h3>
                <p>This week we gave our final presentation of the product to our client. I was able to implement the delete, voting, and admin dashboard functions into the 
		app in the days leading up to the call, so the product was more than ready to go for the scope we were aiming for. Our demo to the client went pretty well, 
		and they seemed happy with what we were able to accomplish. WSU, on the other hand, did not seem to fare well and seemed quite unprepared. When it was their 
		time to present, nobody spoke and they did not seem to know what was going on. When they did demo their application, there were some nice features (such as 
		issue categorization) that they had implemented, but the program was pretty incomplete and rather buggy. The client was audibly angry with their team. It has 
		been an overall great experience working with The Lion Group, and we hope we accomplished everything they wanted. Based on the feedback we got, it seems we have.</p>
                <p>Notes for this week are below:</p>
                <ul>
			<li>We gave our final presentation of the product to the client. They were quite pleased.</li>
                        <li>WSU was able to add some cool features, but overall delivered an incomplete and buggy app.</li>
                        <li>We had a great time working with The Lion Group.</li>
