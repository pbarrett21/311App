	<h2>1/27:</h2>
	<p>The team and our client Morgan Smith established a weekly conference call to discuss the 311 app: Sundays at 1:15.</p> 
	<p>Meeting notes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Disclaimer: we are working on one version of the application, and a team in Washington is working on their own, may collaborate on ideas.</li>
		<li>The goal is a Minimally viable product, the client want to showcase the base features of the app to future investors to take over and be able to deploy.</li>
		<li>“Brain” is the technical lead of this venture</li>
		<li>We will be scheduling ourselves, as well as deciding on implementation for the upcoming project. That means if we have decisions to make about any minute details, as long as they follow the requirements we were provided, we can do as we please. </li>
		<li>He then went over what the “plan” was for how this project is going to be monetized, and therefore how we should approach our future implementations. We need to keep in mind facts such as larger cities most likely already have a dedicated 311 app, and the idea for this one is an application that can be used by many different locations and not just restricted to one area, both catering to people being in multiple cities as well as smaller communities without access to a dedicated 311 application. This ties back to how we don’t need to worry about assigning admin privileges to certain locations yet, as more research will need to be done on their end on how to sort this out.
Further talk on monetization was discussed, such as how these communities should be able to post without having “subscribed”, but we need the administrative privileges as an incentive to subscribe ultimately. </li>

	</ul>

	<h2>2/03:</h2>
	<p>This week, Kyle created a wireframe to show Morgan a base landing-page to try an elicit more requirements. Morgan reiterated that he’s mostly fine with however we want to lay out the application, as long as its mostly a “one-page deal” and sticks to the requirements. </p> 
	<p>Meeting notes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Monetization: a municipality will subscribe to be able to forward issues to the corresponding facility. Worry about these features last.</li>
		<li>Clarification on requirements: ensure everything in the PDF is implemented, and we work on our own accord thereafter. </li>
		<li>Create a timeline containing plans for each week. </li>
		<li>Possibly contact Washington team</li>
	</ul>
	<hr>
	<h2>2/10:</h2>
	 <p>As requested, we approximated a schedule on how we’re going to progress with the project.</p>
	<li>Week 1: Researching the languages and libraries we plan on using for implementation, and begin on front end or templates.</li>
	<li>Week 2: Start on the login system, create different types of users, and getting the post dashboard planned out and slightly started.<li>
	<li>Week 3: Add the features relating to the dashboard, such as posting an issue, upvoting and downvoting posts, editing and deleting posts.</li>	
	<li>Week 4: “Time off” for our midterm week, said we would try to work on touching up the front-end if time allows.</li>
	<li>Week 5: This will be our spring break, no clear goals here
	<li>Week 6: Plans for hosting the application through GitHub, begin working on admin functionality
	<li>Week 7: With all of the above finished, go back and touch up on issues and if there aren’t many, add any quality of life features we can think of.
	<li>Week 8: Testing our application (BAT testing), try features we may/may not be able to finish with our scope, such as advanced admin features, geolocation, etc.

	<p>“Minor” roadblock though, Morgan is unsure of continuing with the 311 app with the teams, states competition from open source projects of a similar nature. He sent an email containing alternatives if we wanted to work with him still, such as another “Neighborhood” App, as well as a few other generic things. He says he is going to contact Jeff to see what the best course of action is, but out of all the application ideas and the fact that we’re already a month in, staying par with this course seems the best outcome for all of us. </p>

	<h2>2/17:</h2>
	<p>Crisis adverted, and we got to talk to the mythical Brain. We got to get down into the gory details with Brain, which was a nice change in pace as everything was more of a top-layer discussion prior to this. We discussed our plans on what we wanted to implement the backend with (NodeJS or Django seemed to be the favored), and we were offered to be able to use AWS from Brain to help us deploy. </p>
	<p> Brain addressed the elephant in the room, I wasn’t sure if he was a part of it or if he was just trying to reassure us, but he told us he was optimistic about the future of this project and was fully onboard to help us with any issues we’ll run into.</p>
		<p> We also got an angular skeleton of project pushed to repo.</p>
		<hr><br>
	<h2>2/24 :</h2>
		<p>This week we had a phone call with both Brain and Morgan. We gave updates on the project progression over the last week and how we felt the progression for the project was going altogether. Since we’ve been working on an Architecture Assignment for class, we shared our findings related to metrics and our planned schedule to see what they thought. </p>
		<p>Brain joined the call later on, and the two liked how things have been going so far. We discussed with Brain using the MEAN stack as well with using AWS. Towards the end of the call, he wanted to switch things up a bit and have a ZOOM conference call with the Washington State team next week, who have been working on their own version of this project. The idea for this is to bounce ideas off of each other and see what approach they are taking as well as give feedback and questions to one another. This meeting is also taking place at a different time to account for the time zone differences between all of us. </p>

	<h2>3/03 :</h2>
		<p>This week started off with a Zoom call Meeting with Brain, Morgan, and the Washington State University team. Here we got to see the progress they’ve made architecture wise, as well as a few notable differences in how they are implementing their application. For starters, instead of doing a web application approach, they are going with a native IOS approach (which I believe was not exactly requested in the requirements). We did seem to be on the same pace, basically laying out the project and getting our architecture assignments rolling before we start implementing</p>
		<p>We also discussed a variety of topics down the road, such as issues overlapping in multiple municipalities, spam detection or malicious users, and our login based approach. This was also another topic in which we are “diverging”, as the Washington State University team plans on going down a device id approach, which has a few implications such as only one account per user.  </p>
		<p> Towards the end of the meeting, we discussed the schedule for a few weeks ahead, namely noting that spring break was coming up, so we wouldn’t be having our conference call coming up.</p>
	<hr><br>
	<h2>Week of March 10-16 :</h2>
		<p>Spring Break – no meeting with Morgan. </p>
		<hr><br>
	<h2>Week of March 17-23 :</h2>
		<p>This week we didn’t have much contact with each other, but progress was made on the login component for the application. Work on the application will start picking up from here, as we are finished with our documentation and laying out the project. We expect to start working on the posting issues for the municipalities soon, and start handing out different parts of the projects to each other.</p>
		<hr><br>
	<h2>Week of March 24-30 :</h2>
		<p>Another “status update” with Morgan, asking us how we felt the project was coming along, and seeing if we thought we were “on-track”. Our response was positive, saying we feel like we can flesh out the application with the requirements he has provided us. With that being said, Brain inquired if we had anymore questions, but most of ours pertain to the admin functionality that will be tackled later down the road, so we don’t exactly have any issues yet. </p>
		<p>We reiterated how we’re approaching completion with the login system, and how we’ve begun work on the layout for the post dashboard</p>
		<hr><br>
	<h2>Week of March 31-April 6 :</h2>
		<p>This meeting we had our 2nd Zoom conference call with Brain, Morgan, and the Washington State team. As we mentioned, their application has turned our quite differently than ours, going for the native mobile application opposed to the web application scheme. One major difference is they seem to be using a Google Maps API to pull the coordinates of a tagged location to save that as an issue. We haven’t seen how they are dividing the municipalities, which will most likely oppose our approach of sectioning off locations with zip code, and providing details pertaining the exact area of concern via a description box with the post. </p> 
		<p>This week we also have the Coding Assignment coming up. I’ve been updating the metrics to compare how our prior goals compare to our goals now that we are closing in on presentations and completing the application. For the most part, we dropped a few features that were deemed unnecessary, such as an additional captcha box before posting an issue, and some of the admin features that Brain and Morgan had initially suggested, but told us not to worry about due to needing additional research on how to contact these local officials and distribute account and whatnot to them. </p>
		<p>I also began working on the testing portion of the assignment. James had handled unit testing, so I thought I’d try out a black box approach for the application testing. We have a lot of forms in our application that need to be filled out and submitted in our Post Dashboard and user account creation. So I tried various approaches to trying to send licit/malformed posts, as well as duplicated accounts and trying to login with accounts that weren’t created and having incorrect information.</p>

	<h2>Week of April 14-April 20 :</h2>
		<p>This week we scheduled another Zoom call for Morgan, Brain, and the WSU team to show our application to them since they won’t be able to make it up here for a live demo. We mainly discussed how we are working on a presentation to give to our class for this week. We discussed a little bit about the last things we’ll be adding to the dashboard, such as upvoting and deleting for the admins, but this phone call was rather short, as Morgan was bedridden. </p>
		<p>We scheduled a Presentation U meeting for Monday, so we’ll be finishing up our presentation and altering it with the feedback we get to be prepared for our in class one on Wednesday. </p>
		<hr><br>
	<h2>Week of April 21-April 27 :</h2>
		<p>On Sunday we presented our application on Zoom with everybody gathered, and Morgan seemed to be very pleased with what we showed him. He stated that he realized it was Easter, so he won’t pester us too much and was recording to show to Brain later, so we might get some feedback in the following days. Morgan didn’t seem too pleased with the WSU team, as they seemed reluctant to present at first, and had a few difficulties with bugs in the presentation, which Morgan remarked that they should get those handled before their final presentations for class. He said that he had sent good feedback to us back at UK and thanked us for what we showed him. Now, we just have one more presentation this coming up Friday.</p>
